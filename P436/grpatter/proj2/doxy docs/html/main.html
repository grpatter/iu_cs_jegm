<h1>Operating Systems Documentation</h1><h3>Project 2: Threads<br />Greg Patterson - grpatter@indiana.edu<br />
Eric Spencer - erspence@indiana.edu<br />
Indiana University Fall 2009 </h3><br />
Objectives:<br />
 To demonstrate the proper use of synchronization primitives.<br />
 To solve synchronization problems both on paper and in software.<br />
 To understand how system calls affect thread scheduling in the operating system.<br />
 To demonstrate an understanding of how to use the POSIX Threads library.<br />
 To develop skills in testing and debugging threaded code.<br />
 To demonstrate and develop your C programming skills.<br />
 To develop defensive programming techniques.<br />
 To develop critical software development strategies (i.e., documentation, testing).<p />
 Part 1: The Dining Philosophers Problem<br />
 In this part of the assignment you will be implementing two solutions to the Dining Philoso-
phers Problem. You will implement the solution in Figure 6.15 in the text which is not deadlock
free. Additionally you will implement another solution that is
deadlock free. This pseudo code is taken from the second edition of \Operating Systems: Design
and Implementation" by Tanenbaum and Woodhull (1997). <p />
Part 2: Work Pool Problem<br />
Overview<br />
In this problem, there is a pool of work to be done, and we have a pool of threads to use to
do it. The pool of work should be drawn from using a first in first out policy (it is a queue).
Furthermore, the workers require exclusive access to shared resources to complete the tasks -
the resources that are needed are task dependent. Each task takes a certian amount of time,
at which point the worker can proceed to a new task. New work enters the queue at random
intervals. If the queue is empty, workers should wait briely, then check for more work.<p />
