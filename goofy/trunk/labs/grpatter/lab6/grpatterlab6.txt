Goal:
Become familiar with motor hardware on Goofy
Become familiar with the sound processor on Goofy
Begin to understand analog<->digital sound

2)
Approach
Read through the lab write-up, then follow the directions given.
We wrote the motor based part of the lab first, and tested it until
we understood how the different bits interact. We then updated our makefile
and moved on to the sound part of the lab.

Problems
The lab was fairly straightforward, though the bits for each motor were a bit
confusing as to how they interacted at first. After some testing, it made sense however.
The sound processing is still a bit unclear, but at least we got some exposure to it
and began to understand it. What exactly is the wav-processor doing and how does it generate
the results it does?

We were able to get both parts of the lab functioning, correctly, at least as far as we
could tell. It was cool to actually make goofy do something, and to begin to understand
the system as a whole, or at least the possibilities of integration that are present.
