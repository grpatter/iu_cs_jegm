1.) The goal of this lab was to get Goofy back to it's original state. To make him be able to move forward, rotate, do it's little sing / play sound thingy and optionally have him dance.

2.) We approached this lab by extending the message handling code we wrote in labs 7 and 8. We print out the actions we wrote and make a call to the appropriate function to perform the action it defaults to. 

3.) No real problems on this one. Mostly it was just copy and paste from previous labs.

4.) This lab was very straightforward. We simply extended the work we did over the previous two labs and
	integrated it with the motors and sound code we did earlier.
