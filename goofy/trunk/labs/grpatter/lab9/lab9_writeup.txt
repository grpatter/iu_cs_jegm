1.) The idea was to return Goofy to 'default' behavior by programming him to 
	execute actions as requested from the remote puck. It has 3 buttons, so we
	must support at least 3 actions and they should be the standard 'understood'
	functions as it would be used by a child. We were instructed to target
	'play sound', 'move forward', and 'rotate' behavior as the goals of the lab.

2.) The approach was to simply extend the message handling code we wrote in labs 7 and 8.
	When we print out what message is being read, we also make a call to the appropriate
	function to perform the action it defaults to. We have play music, move forward, and rotate.

3.) //TODO
	//UNTESTED as of this time.

4.) This lab was very straightforward. We simply extended the work we did over the previous two labs and
	integrated it with the motors and sound code we did earlier.
