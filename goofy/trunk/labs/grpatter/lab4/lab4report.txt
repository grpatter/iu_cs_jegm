Goal:
To learn how to modify existing code for usage on Goofy Giggles.
To learn how to connect to Goofy Giggles platform.
To learn how to compile (and use makefile) specifically for the ARM processor.
To learn how to move code from terminal to ARM platform (Goofy)

2)
Approach
Read through the lab write-up, then follow the directions given.


3)
Problems
There were very few problems with this lab, other than the confusion about
the best way to write a makefile. Once we got that working, things went smoothly
until we tried to move the word count program to run on goofy. We recieved several
errors, but after discussing with Eric (who met with you for office hours), we
realized we hadn't done the gg_init call and weren't printing properly. We fixed
the issue, but the trace is below for reference.
