1.) The idea was to take into streams of 1's and 0's and produce legible instructions (8bit) that
	emulate a message decoder. The instructions are used to understand signals from the Goofy remote
	control device (puck).

2.) The approach is to watch for strings of 0's or 1's. A string of 0's identifies the beginning of a message, and 
	when a 1 is seen the payload of the message had started. You then count the number of bits until the next low->high
	transition which indicates the entire first bit. You do this 8 times until you recieve a full instruction. Then you 
	repeat as long as data is still being sent.

3.) The issues we had were simply understanding and approaching the task. The instructions were somewhat vague in
	specifics. Our 'real' issue was that we get a 1 bit at the beginning of every instruction after the first one.
	Jon is taking a look at it now.

4.) We read instructions properly, but have somethign wrong in the output of the instructions after the first one.
	Jon has done alot on this lab, as I've been very busy with a family emergency and getting caught up there. I understand
	the general concepts and the code (helped on some of it) but Jon has a far better grasp than I do for this lab.
