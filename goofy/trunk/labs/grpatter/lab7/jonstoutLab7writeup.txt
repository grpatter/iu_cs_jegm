1.) The goal of this lab was to create a message decoder that took in multiple 1's and 0's and turned
	them into a readable 8 bit instruction that can be used to decode signals from Gooofy's controller.

2.) The idea is to look for a long line of 0's. This is the begining of each message. Once you have this long line
	of 0's if you come across a 1 then your message has started. From there on you count your 1's and 0's untill
	your next low to high transition occours. This is your first bit. You continue untill you have all 8 bits and
	then you repeat the process to look for more instuctions.

3.) There where to main issues. The first was actually finding out what to do. The lab was pretty vauge in 
	making that point. The second issue, which has yet to be fixed, is that we get a 1 at the begining 
	of every instruction prior to the first. Not sure where that problem is but I'm working on it.

4.) As stated above, the decoded reads the first instruction but fails on providing the correct following
	instructions.
