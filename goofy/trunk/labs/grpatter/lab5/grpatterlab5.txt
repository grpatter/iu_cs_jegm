1)
Goal:
Learn how to write Goofy runnable code to control hardware
To become familiar with LED peripheral hardware on Goofy and how it interfaces.
Understand how to change state by modifying addresses and registers.

2)
Approach
Read through the lab write-up, then follow the directions given.


3)
Problems
This lab was fairly straightforward, and given the hardware port/bit table really
helped us get this done. Things were easy to understand and made sense, given a little conversation
about the addresses. 

The first time through, we were able to get the functions working as intended, though we later
realized we didn't design the second (loading bar type LED display) in a way that was exactly
in line with what was requested. We determined how to re-design it (simply using loops and breaks in 
different places) and could make the changes to make the behavior as expected.
